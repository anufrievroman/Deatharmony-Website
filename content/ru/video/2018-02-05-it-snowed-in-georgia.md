<p>It snowed over 6 inches in Georgia this week, power went out so we decided go outside and make a nice partner fan wintery video!  We both wore our lovely black outfits from Harmonic threads and Divinior to contrast with the snow and it turned out awesome! We worked on some new fun Partner fan ideas and patterns, some from doodle bytes, some from just jamming and coming with ideas, Love how well some of the partner flowers came out and hope y'all enjoy!</p>
