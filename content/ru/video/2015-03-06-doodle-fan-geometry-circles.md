<p>This is an intro video so it is short and simple. This is the first video of a tutorial series I'm going to attempt to do. In this first video we go over the 3 basic circles most commonly used in tech fan spinning(all tech spinning) This video will break down each of the 3 circles individually and show you how to statically move between them.</p>
