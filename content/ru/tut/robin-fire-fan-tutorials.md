## Same Direction Behind the Back Weaves
This video is for continuous behind the back weaves in same direction. I also recommend checking out REMs tutorial on b2b weaves as well

## The Meltdown (Cosmo)
This tutorial is exclusively for the Meltdown move on russian grip fans. Unlike its tech fan counterpart, this move is very technical and requires a series of grip switch changes that may be difficult to master. I would rank this an Advanced move, so dont get frustrated if you struggle with it!
