Legendary tutorials with Corey White! In these lessons Corey teaches the basics of American spinning style.

## Grip Transitions
This tutorial will discuss the basic ways to grip a fan and how to transition from grip to grip. It also goes over possible moves to do from some of the basic static grip positions. This was made as a project for Goddard College by Corey White who is in the IBA 2 program.

## I quartered my practice sesh
A practice sesh full of more 90 degree/mixed plane stuff. There is also some me weirdness...so um...yeah...thats kind of funny I guess. I recorded it a while ago but it took me this long to decide if I should post it.
Part One- Very boring. Moving through basic mixed plane positions at 90 degrees.
Part Two-Playing around and dancing with the mixed planes at 90 degree angles and more.
