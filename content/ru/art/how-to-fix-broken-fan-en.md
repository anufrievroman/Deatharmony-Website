Spokes of the fans often break and even if you weld it back it will break even faster again. Here is the method that I use for a quick and cheap fix!

Broken fire fan:
{{< figure library="true" src="art-broken-fan/1.jpg" title="" lightbox="false" >}}

Find a piece of wire similar to that used for the fan and a bit softer. Bend the wire but less than really required (to crate some strain after fixing).

{{< figure library="true" src="art-broken-fan/2.jpg" title="" lightbox="false" >}}

Attach to the fan using tape as shown in the photo. If attached well, the frame will only become stronger.

{{< figure library="true" src="art-broken-fan/3.jpg" title="" lightbox="false" >}}

It could actually be nicer than in the photo, but you got the idea. In my experience the tape does not suffer a lot from the fire, but make sure to check its state from time to time.
