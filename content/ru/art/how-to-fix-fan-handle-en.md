From time to time leather fan handle breaks, and it's better to start to repair it as early it starts to break.

So, first, remove the old thread:

Put some glue between the ring an the leather.

Don't be like me and remove the thread first and only then apply the glue :) Next, stitch the leather again.

Add some more glue to the nodes.

Well, now it's a bit better, good luck!
