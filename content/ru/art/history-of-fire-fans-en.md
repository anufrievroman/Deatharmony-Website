The history of fire fan spinning is not as simple as it may seem, as the appearance of seemingly random videos featuring different techniques, tricks, and basic principles of fan manipulation, grew into the opposition between two leading ideas of the fan spinning and even reduced to the "War of the rings" :)

## 2006 - 2008
The first page was open by an American artist Grimm Zimmer, who released his first video at December 26, 2006

For the several years Grimm was considered the best and unique tech fans spinner. This status was supported by many other videos released later. One of those was the "Chuu Chuu for Fans..." released at November 20, 2008.
It contained lots of elements, which later became the basic of the American style spinning.:

## 2009
Meanwhile in Russia, spinners also made fans tech experiments using alternative construction with a bigger ring. Marina "Matchbox" Vinokurova became an author of the first Russian tech fans video with her "Fire fans practice" released at 19 of January, 2009.

A video by Rem "Fans Technique 2009" started a new wave of the Russian fan spinning. Published October 3rd, 2009, this video featured the alternative way of the fan spinning, which was started by Marina and based on the poi spinning technique

## 2010
This year was marked by visit of MCP to Moscow. During those workshops a new Russian fans video "Moscow Tech Fans Convention 2010" was created. Remarkably, the next fan spinning convention will take place only in seven years!

As you can see, the American spinning style was mainly based on the double staff and hoop technique, whereas the St. Petersburg style was more based on the poi technique. As years passed, the differences between the American and Russian technique was growing and finally on 25th of May, 2010 the USA declared the "war" in the video "Evolution of Fans - Tech Blog" 2010.

At the same time new video of Alina Alinka-Murka Pavlova showed the fans isolation variations:

Corey White also developed a new style with mixed planes (3D). During a short period she published several videos with the most remarkable being her performance at Flow Show 2.

The answer to the USA's "war declaration" was published on June 25, 2010. Russian grip spinners have been making the videos and exchanging it for a month, creating a video response called U.S.S.R. - Tech Fans (Union's of Soviet Spinners Response). Later U.S.S.R team will be publishing similar collaborations almost every year.

In response to that, Grimm [declared total mobilization](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1034221120&v=wall&story_fbid=135197116501352) of the US fan army. However, any other major US collaborations were never published.
